            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <dl>
              <dt>Q: What does LGBT stand for?</dt>
              <dd>A: LGBT stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender. It is an acronym used to represent a diverse group of individuals with different sexual orientations and gender identities.</dd>
          
              <dt>Q: What is the importance of LGBT inclusivity?</dt>
              <dd>A: LGBT inclusivity is crucial because it promotes equality, respect, and acceptance for individuals regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It helps create a society that values diversity and ensures that everyone can live authentically and without discrimination.</dd>
          
              <dt>Q: What is the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity?</dt>
              <dd>A: Sexual orientation refers to a person's emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction to others. It includes categories such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual. On the other hand, gender identity relates to an individual's internal sense of their own gender, which may or may not align with the sex assigned to them at birth.</dd>
          
              <dt>Q: What is the difference between transgender and cisgender?</dt>
              <dd>A: Transgender individuals have a gender identity that does not match the sex they were assigned at birth. For example, someone assigned male at birth who identifies as female is a transgender woman. Cisgender individuals, on the other hand, have a gender identity that aligns with the sex assigned to them at birth.</dd>
          
              <dt>Q: What is the purpose of using gender-neutral pronouns?</dt>
              <dd>A: Gender-neutral pronouns are used to respect and acknowledge individuals who may not identify within the traditional gender binary (male or female). They provide an inclusive language option for people who identify as non-binary, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming.</dd>
          
              <dt>Q: How can I be an ally to the LGBT community?</dt>
              <dd>A: Being an ally involves actively supporting and advocating for the rights and well-being of the LGBT community. Some ways to be an ally include educating yourself on LGBT issues, using inclusive language, challenging stereotypes and discrimination, and standing up against prejudice.</dd>
          
              <dt>Q: Are there any legal protections for LGBT individuals?</dt>
              <dd>A: Legal protections for LGBT individuals vary by country and jurisdiction. Some places have enacted laws to protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in areas such as employment, housing, and public services. However, legal protections may still be limited in certain regions.</dd>
          
              <dt>Q: Where can I find resources for LGBT support?</dt>
              <dd>A: There are several organizations and online resources available to provide support and information on LGBT issues. Some well-known organizations include GLAAD, Human Rights Campaign, and The Trevor Project. Additionally, local LGBT community centers or organizations in your area may offer resources and support.</dd>

              <dt>Q: Why create an inclusivity checker?</dt>
              <dd>A: Inclusivity is essential within the LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning, and others) community. It ensures that individuals within the community, regardless of their gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic, feel welcomed, respected, and value </dd>

              <dt>Q: Why is inclusivity important?</dt>
              <dd>A: Inclusivity promotes visibility and representation of diverse identities within the LGBTQ+ community. It empowers individuals within the community to challenge practices that can be seen as discriminatory and to advocate for their rights to be included.</dd>

              <dt>Q: What is inclusive language and why is it needed?</dt>
              <dd>A: Inclusive language are phrases and words that avoid stereotypes and biases which discriminate, exclude or demean a group of people or community.</dd>

              <dt>Q: Why is GROB necessary? What does it do?</dt>
              <dd>A: G.R.O.B (Get Rid Of Bias) is an innovative online tool created to help people and organisations looking to create inclusive content by removing any unconscious bias that may be present in their literature.
