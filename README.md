# TEAM: 🌈 Our P.R.I.D.E (Partnership Renders Incredible Developer Energy) 🥳
![GROB - Get Rid Of Bias Inclusivity Checker Pride Banner](assets/images/rm-grob-header.webp)


## ***Criteria***

Following the topic of Pride Representation our team agreed on an idea suggested by @CallumDennisIE to create a tool that will support the removal of unconscious bias from written material. Although the different aspects of bias (e.g. sex, race, gender, age etc) is a huge area, we decided to keep our focus on addressing bias within the LGBTQ+ community. 
We addressed the applicable criteria for this project by:

- ✨ Using the Materialise CSS framework to create a three-page website.
- ✨ Including other technologies such as HTML and JavaScript.
- ✨ Adding information to the README template.
- ✨ Using GitHub Project to plan, delegate tasks and execute the project.
- ✨ Completing and deploying the project on GitHub.

During our second get-together work was divided between the group with members putting themselves forward to tackle particular tasks.

## ***Intro***
G.R.O.B (Get Rid Of Bias) is an innovative online tool created to help people and organisations looking to create inclusive content by removing any unconscious bias that may be present in their literature. With a particular focus on promoting inclusivity of the LGBTQ+ community G.R.O.B provides alternative words to replace any  that may be regarded as bias within your material.

## ***Goal***

***Problem Statement:***

The world has changed to support the idea that everyone has the right to feel valued and included. Words that have always been acceptable, e.g. A family raised by mum and dad, can now be seen as being non-inclusive. For many, knowing the right alternative words to use can be challenging so G.R.O.B provides insights into alternative inclusive words e.g. A family raised by parents.

***Objectives:***
- ✨ To create a tool that makes written language more inclusive for the LGBTQ+ community.
- ✨ To highlight where unconscious bias may exist within written material and provide an opportunity to replace that with a more inclusive term.
- ✨ Develop an intuitive tool that is easy for clients to use.

***Target Audience:***  
Business to consumer (free for non-commercial content)

Business to business (premium version for organisations)

***Benefits:***

Fosters inclusivity within the LGBTQ+ community.
Supports the idea that we all matter and have the right to be included.

## ***Tech***
In the tech section, we provide information about the technology stack, dependencies, and any technical details related to the project. 

# WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE???

## ***Challenges***
Our main challenge was in deciding how to create our database of words as we wanted to avoid using derogatory or negative terms during this challenge, so we focused on subjects that began or ended with the word ‘man’ e.g. manhunt > pursuit and also family related terms e.g. brother/sister > sibling.

# DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT TO ADD ANY OTHER CHALLENGES OR ANY BUG ISSUES TO INCLUDE? 

## ***Future Updates***
Future updates of G.R.O.B include expanding its reach so that other biases are included e.g., racism, sexism, ageism, and gender equality.
